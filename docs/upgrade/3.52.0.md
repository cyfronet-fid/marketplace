# Upgrade to 3.52.0

## Standard procedure

All steps run in production scope.

- make database dump and all application files.
- `bundle install --deployment --without development test`
- `bundle exec rake assets:clean assets:precompile`
- `rails db:migrate`

## Special steps

- This release contains changes in PC's naming conventions,
  so it's necessary to run task `rake rdt:remove_vocabularies`
  and then do an import in order:

- `rake import:vocabularies`
- `rake import:catalogues`
- `rake import:providers`
- `rake import:resources`
- `rake import:datasources`
- `rake import:guidelines`

- It's recommended to run task `rake friendly_id:heal` to remove hash addition
  in the link of published resources which have
  a deleted duplicate with slug not containg hash
