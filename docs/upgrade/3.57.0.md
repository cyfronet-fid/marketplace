# Upgrade to 3.56.0

## Standard procedure

All steps run in production scope.

- make database dump and all application files.
- `bundle install --deployment --without development test`
- `bundle exec rake assets:clean assets:precompile`
- `rails db:migrate`

## Special steps

This version contains ruby and rails upgrade, so you need
to run migrations. `rake encrypt_cookies:up` is
a task rotating cookies encryption
to the SHA256 instead of SHA1
If something goes wrong you can use `rake encryp_cookies:down`
to revert this migration.

For development purposes steps to make upgrade: (assuming, that you use
asdf as package manager for yarn, node and ruby)

- Install updated ruby, nodejs and yarn
  - `asdf plugin update ruby`
  - `asdf install ruby 3.3.1`
  - `asdf plugin update nodejs`
  - `asdf install nodejs 20.12.2`
  - `asdf plugin update yarn`
  - `asdf install yarn 1.22.19`
- Set new versions to the mp environment:
  - `asdf local ruby 3.3.1`
  - `asdf local nodejs 20.12.2`
  - `asdf local yarn 1.22.19`
- Install new dependencies:
  - Ubuntu/WSL: `sudo apt install librsvg2-2 libvips42`
  - MacOS: `brew install librsvg vips`
- Run `bundle install`

## IMPORTANT NOTICE

Now we don't use webpacker to build assets.
Because of custom esbuild config, we don't have `--watch` option included
(but it renders assets way faster than webpacker). After doing changes
in any front-end file (it means js, css, adding an image or font)
and by the first run in the new version type in terminal:

- `yarn build`
- `yarn build:css`
