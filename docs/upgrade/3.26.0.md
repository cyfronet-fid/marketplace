# Upgrade to 3.26.0

## Standard procedure

All steps run in production scope.

- make database dump and all application files.
- `bundle install --deployment --without development test`
- `bundle exec rake assets:clean assets:precompile`
- `rails db:migrate`

## Additional info

### Added JMS::Publisher

The publisher is disabled by default.
It can be enabled by setting 'MP_STOMP_PUBLISHER_ENABLED=true'.
Basic STOMP envs stay the same, but there are several extra ones that can be set:

- `MP_STOMP_PUBLISHER_LOGGER_PATH`: JMS publisher log file,
- `MP_STOMP_PUBLISHER_TOPIC`: topic to publish to.

The aforementioned envs must be set on sidekiq/worker instance.
They have no impact on other instances.
