# Upgrade to 3.56.0

# Standard procedure

All steps run in production scope.

- make database dump and all application files.
- `bundle install --deployment --without development test`
- `bundle exec rake assets:clean assets:precompile`
- `rails db:migrate`

# Special steps

This version adds foreign key to data_administrators and links the newly created
with existing users. The same linking operation runs every time, when a new user
is logged in. Nevertheless there is a need to link existing users with data_administrators
enetities. To do this, just run:

`rake migration:user_id`

This version contains update postgresql to 16.4
To make a migration we need follow steps below:

- make db dump, eg:

```
pg_dump -U username mp_development > dump.sql
```

- if you use docker for running db service, remove volume
  assigned to db
- run docker containers with the new configuration
- load db dump to the new version, eg:

```
psql -U username mp_development < dump.sql
```

Then everything should be working.
