# Upgrade to 3.51.0

## Standard procedure

All steps run in production scope.

- make database dump and all application files.
- `bundle install --deployment --without development test`
- `bundle exec rake assets:clean assets:precompile`
- `rails db:migrate`

## Special steps

- Run `rake viewable:cache_views_count`.
  It loads views count cache to the presentable objects:
  - services
  - datasources
  - providers
  - offers
  - bundles

It is necessary to run, because from now serializers
get only data from db and do not update statistics updates.
Statistics for object are updated when someone visit page.
In the production environment default logging level is `info` `debug`,
so if you want to have less logs on your machine,
you can run this task with log_level argument, eg. `rake viewable:cache_views_count[info]`
