# Standard procedure

TODO: @wziajka please describe

# Special steps
In the scope of this release we are moving a lot of items from affiliation to
project and we are creating master ticket for the project. 2 dedicated rake
tasks are created for this purpose:

```
RAILS_ENV=production rails jira:migrate_projects
RAILS_ENV=production rails projects:migrate_from_affiliation
```

List of project names and emails outputted from last task
should be passed to @agpul and @roksanaer.
