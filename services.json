The implementation of the service relies on the DONA/Handle persistent identifier solution.\n\nB2HANDLE can be used by middleware applications, end-user tools and other service to reliably identify data objects over longer timespans and through changes in object location or ownership. The B2HANDLE service encompasses management of identifier namespaces (Handle prefixes), establishment of policies and business workflows, operation of Handle servers and technical services, and a user-friendly Python library for general interaction with Handle servers and EUDAT-specific extensions. B2HANDLE is mostly transparents to end-users, shielding them from the complexity of infrastructure details. In the background, B2HANDLE operates as a federation and based on policies that aim to ensure high availability of Handle resolution by cross-site mirroring of Handles. B2HANDLE supports a dedicated Handle record structure (a PID profile) for the safe data management within an infrastructure with a given topology. By relying on features of the PID profile, end-users can, for instance, ensure authenticity of objects with checksums and timestamps and account for replicated objects across multiple locations.\n\n### Note:\n\nTo mint PIDs a prefix is required.\n\n\n### To access the service you need to:\n\n   1.

exploit distributed\nand heterogeneous clouds to process data. Aiming to reduce the learning curve as well as\nthe operational cost of managing community specific services running on distributed cloud,\nDODAS completely automates the process of provisioning, creating, managing and accessing\na pool of heterogeneous computing and storage resources.\n\n### DODAS provides:\n\n  - A comprehensive approach to opportunistic computing, with the possibility of\n  orchestrate multiple centers (e.g. campus facilities, public or private clouds,\n  to gather all available computing and storage resources).\n  - A simple solution for elastic computing site extensions, e.g. extension\n  of allocated resources in order to absorb peaks of usage.\n  - An easy and controlled procedure to dynamically instantiate a spot ‘Data Analysis Facility’,\n  for example a mission specific site. This is meant as the generation of an ephemeral WLCG-Tier\n  as a Service to share computing and data resources with collaborators.\n  - The support to create HTCondor batch systems and BigData Platform\n  on demand over multi-backend IaaS cloud resources.\n\n\n### How to access the service\n\nTo access the DODAS service, users are first required to [register online][1].\n\n\n### See the
