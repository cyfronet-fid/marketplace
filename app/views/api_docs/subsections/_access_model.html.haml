%p The following applies to the Ordering API.

%h3 OMS roles
%p
  An OMS can have two roles in the context of Project Item:
  %ul
    %li
      %span primary: if selected by the EGI Resource provider to handle that offering orders,
    %li
      %span secondary: the default OMS.
%p In case the primary OMS wasn't selected, then the default OMS is considered both as primary and secondary OMS.
%p
  An OMS can have two roles in the context of a Project:
  %ul
    %li
      %span mediator: the default OMS,
    %li
      %span provider: every OMS, which is a Primary OMS of any Project Item of the Project.

%h3 Read access
%p
  If OMS has any role in Project or Project Item, it can read it. The Project Item's field
  %code user_secrets
  will have obfuscated values (keys will be visible).
%p
  Every OMS with a role in Project or Project Item has read access to all associated Messages. However, the content of
  Messages with
  %code user_direct
  scope will be obfuscated.
  Messages with
  %code internal
  scope will not be disclosed to users.

%h3 Write access
%p A Project cannot be changed by API.
%p A Project Item can be changed by its primary OMS.

%p
  Messages have fields scope and role, which determine their write access.
  The scope can have values
  %code public
  ,
  %code internal
  or
  %code user_direct
  \.
  The role can have values
  %code user
  ,
  %code provider
  or
  %code mediator.
%p
  The write permissions for different combinations of scope and role are as follows. They also differ slightly
  for Project and Project Item Messages.
