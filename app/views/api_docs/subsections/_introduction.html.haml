  This is the API of the EGI Marketplace. It enables integration in two areas: offering and ordering. Their audience is
  providers and communities.
%p
  Below, we present an overview of the EOSC Marketplace APIs in scope of interoperability patterns regarding order
  management. Users are presented with a consistent EOSC Marketplace user interface, while communities, providers and
  operations team can leverage the APIs to achieve high interoperability level and provide value to the users in a way
  they see fit.

  Integrators (providers and communities) can choose from a range of integration levels, adding flexibility.
%p
  In a minimal setup, a provider can use Marketplace UI to configure their offerings and leverage SOMBO for order
  management, avoiding any implementation and integration cost whatsoever.
%p
  On the other hand, one can choose to use an in-house system, that fully integrates with EOSC Marketplace APIs both
  for offering and order management. Existing community systems can be extended this way, exposing the communities to
  EOSC users while maintaining the same set of tools for operations.

%p
  Exposes functions that are necessary to manage offerings, including their technical parameters and ordering
  configuration.

%h3 Ordering
%p
  It is an API that enables integration with the ordering process. External Order Management Systems (OMSes) can use it
