%p The following applies to the Ordering API.

%p
  The Ordering API is meant to support integration of external Order Management Systems (OMSes).
  %br
  The interoperability layer is based on the Ordering API with asynchronous triggers, that can be accessed by interested
  parties.
%p
  We provide a
  %a{ href: "https://github.com/cyfronet-fid/oms-adapter-jira/", target: "_blank" } reference OMS adapter
  that integrates with Jira for order handling.

%h3 Integration steps
%p
  In order to integrate your ordering process with MP you have to follow a few steps:
  %ul
    %li
      %span Obtain an OMS registration in our test infrastructure,
    %li
      %span Connect your instance of an OMS adapter (you can use our reference Jira implementation for this),
    %li
      %span Switch to the production environment.
