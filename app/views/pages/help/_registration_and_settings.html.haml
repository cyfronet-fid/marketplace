    In case you want to access technologies or obtain assistance from the international technical teams on the
    most suitable solutions, you need to log in via available services. There are different mechanisms to authenticate
    users and to grant appropriate access levels. The Marketplace is tightly integrated with already available services
    from both EUDAT and EGI infrastructure (e.g. Service Portfolio Management Tool, Operational Tools, GOCDB).

  = render "pages/card", parent: "help-registration-and-settings", name: "what",
      title: "What the difference between registered and unregistered user?" do
    The primary difference is that an unregistered account doesn't have login credentials associated with it.
    This effectively means that we don't know who you are and your profile is restricted from certain actions.
    An unregistered users donâ€™t have the possibility to fully use the EOSC marketplace functionality.
    Such functionalities as the service catalog and possibility to ask a question about the service is the same
    for Registered and Unregistered Users.
    But Only Registered Users have access to the ordering process, modification and possibility to create a project.

    title: "How can I able to review/ edit my user profile?" do
    The Marketplace is tightly integrated with already available services from both EUDAT and EGI infrastructure,
    so in case you want to change your profile information,
    it should be done on the infrastructure which is used while you log in to the Marketplace.

    title: "Am I able to remove my account?" do
    There is no set up account in the Marketplace. You log in to the platform by using already existing  accounts.
    So there is no physical account in the Marketplace to be deleted.
