## Development environment

### Requirements

We will need:
  * ruby (specific version can be found in [.tool-versions](.tool-versions)).
    Recommented way to manage ruby versions is to use [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf)
    with [asdf-ruby](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-ruby) plugin
  * nodejs (specific version can be found in [.tool-versions](.tool-versions)).
    Recommented way to manage nodejs versions is to use [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf)
    with [asdf-nodejs](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-nodejs) plugin.
  * [postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org)

### Setup

  * First time run `/bin/setup`. It will install bundler, foreman,
    dependencies and setup databases (development and test).
  * After update run `/bin/update`. It will update dependencies, run db
    migrations and restart currently started application.

### Generating DB entries for development
To simplify development `dev:prime` rake task is created. Right now it generates
services with random title and description (this generation is done using
`faker` gem). In the future this task will be extended with additional data.

```
rails dev:prime     # Remove existing services and generate 100 new services
rails dev:prime[50] # Remove existing services and generate 50 new services
```

## Elasticserach
Elasticsearch is used for full text service search.

On Debian/Ubuntu/Mint Elasticsearch installation is quite simple
(but it doesn't work, see below):
```
sudo apt-get install elasticsearch
```

The version included in ubuntu 16.04 and 17.10 is buggy and outdated, so it should be
installed manually through deb file as described below.

If your disto does not include this package use [instructions from
elasticsearch.org](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elastic-stack/current/index.html).

Use `service` command to control the server:
```
sudo service elasticsearch start
```
or you can also use `systemctl`, it shouldn't matter which one you use.

In order to inspect it you can use
[ElasticHQ](http://www.elastichq.org/gettingstarted.html) (plugin option is
quick and easy).

## Run

To start web application in development mode (with auto refresh capability when
css/js files change) use following command:

```
./bin/server
```

By default application should start on [http://localhost:5000]().
