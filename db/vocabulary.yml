      in the Biological,  Agri-Food and Medical Sciences – i.e. Health & Food – continue
      to establish themselves as research, innovation and skills hubs and as a motor
      for economic impact. This is reflected in increasing levels of industrial access

      The energy sector is key to social and economic development. Especially
      in some non-OECD countries the energy sector sees very high growth rates due to
      rising GDP. However, it contributes significantly to global CO2 emissions. For
      the EU, the reduction of CO2 emissions in a sustainable framework is a major driver
      of its energy policy. This provides opportunities for new technologies both for
      application within and outside of the EU.

      are achieved by the research performed at RIs. However, the RIs are much more

    description: |
      Traditionally, large collections of books, or the place in which the
      collection is housed. However, the term library has extended its meaning to refer
      to any collection, including digital sources, resources, and services. The collections
      can be of print, audio, and visual materials in numerous formats, including maps,
      prints, documents, microform (microfilm/microfiche), CDs, cassettes, videotapes,
      DVDs, video games, e-books, audiobooks and many other electronic resources. A
      research library is a collection of useful material for research use. A library
      is organised for use and maintained by a public body, an institution, a corporation,
      or a private individual. In addition to providing materials, libraries also provide
      the services of librarians who are experts at finding and organising information
      and at interpreting information needs. Modern libraries are increasingly being
      redefined as places to get unrestricted access to information in many formats
      and from many sources. They are extending services beyond the physical walls of
      a building, by providing material accessible by electronic means, and by providing
      the assistance of librarians in navigating and analysing tremendous amounts of
      information with a variety of digital tools. Libraries are valuable to all scientific
      domains; however, they are of specific relevance to Humanities research which
      relies on access to historical and rare collections of unique artefacts (e.g.
      primary sources such as ancient manuscripts) and other sources to study those
      artefacts and works (secondary and tertiary sources) usually held within libraries
      and otherwise hardly accessible. A scientific discipline called library and information
      science, an interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary field dedicated to the analysis,
      collection, organisation, classification, manipulation, preservation, retrieval
      and dissemination of information resources, has established itself at the crossroads
      between social sciences, humanities and computer sciences. Historically, library
      science has also included archival science.

    name: In Situ Marine/Freshwater Observatories
    description: |
      Platforms and sensor technologies deployed in situ to collect environmental
      data (including physical, chemical and biological observations) in support of
      aquatic environmental research and management activities. These facilities, including
      marine/freshwater research centres, provide a base for trans-disciplinary research
      and training, with access to marine and freshwater field sites, and equipment
      (including research vessels that may carry large exchangeable underwater equipment/instruments
      ) for survey and experimental opportunities and often supporting environmental
      observations and the collection of long-term time series data sets (a.o. on biodiversity).
      Typical equipment includes: Buoys; Argo; gliders; autonomous underwater vehicles;
      remotely operated vehicle (Victor); Tide gauges; deep sea laboratories. Ship-time
      for stock assessments, polar supply, naval research, and educational courses and
      non- academic research are not considered in this context. For this inventory
      the atmospheric measurement facilities are kept as a separate subdomain. This
      implies that some marine research centres will also fall under this subdomain
      if they host an atmospheric measurement site.

    description: |
      Accounting normally for organised sets of unpublished and almost always
      unique historical records, or the physical place they are located, archives contain
      primary source documents (texts, maps, pictures etc.) in physical but also increasingly
      digital form (e.g. text archives structured in databases) that have accumulated
      over the course of an individual or organisation''s lifetime. In general, archives
      consist of records that have been selected for permanent or long-term preservation
      on grounds of their enduring cultural, historical, or evidentiary value. Archives
      are thus particularly relevant to the Humanities, chiefly to historians but also
      to many other Humanities researchers dealing with primary sources of various kinds.
      A scientific discipline called archival science, dedicated to the study and practice
      of organising, preserving, and providing access to information and materials in
      archives, has established itself within the Humanities: History Archives, Literature
      and Text Archives.

      A digital data archive is a centre of expertise in data acquisition,
      preservation, management, dissemination and promotion of an access to the national
      and international collections and repositories of digital data. These type of
      RIs are particularly acute to the social sciences, which often rely on the aggregation
      of longitudinal data, and to the humanities, which often rely on preservation,
      but they can be relevant for other domains, particularly, the life and environmental
      sciences and the medical sciences.
