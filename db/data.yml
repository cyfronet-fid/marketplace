        description: |
          B2HANDLE is the distributed service for minting, storing, managing and accessing persistent identifiers (PIDs) and essential metadata (PID records) as well as managing PID namespaces. The implementation of the service relies on the DONA/Handle persistent identifier solution.

          B2HANDLE can be used by middleware applications, end-user tools and other service to reliably identify data objects over longer timespans and through changes in object location or ownership. The B2HANDLE service encompasses management of identifier namespaces (Handle prefixes), establishment of policies and business workflows, operation of Handle servers and technical services, and a user-friendly Python library for general interaction with Handle servers and EUDAT-specific extensions. B2HANDLE is mostly transparents to end-users, shielding them from the complexity of infrastructure details. In the background, B2HANDLE operates as a federation and based on policies that aim to ensure high availability of Handle resolution by cross-site mirroring of Handles. B2HANDLE supports a dedicated Handle record structure (a PID profile) for the safe data management within an infrastructure with a given topology. By relying on features of the PID profile, end-users can, for instance, ensure authenticity of objects with checksums and timestamps and account for replicated objects across multiple locations.

          ### Note:

          To mint PIDs a prefix is required.


          ### To access the service you need to:

             1. Requests access to PID service or namespace (Prefix) select one of service options below.

        description: |
          B2Note allows to easily create, search and manage annotations. An annotation is a keyword or commentary attached to a dete object (data collection, file) that explains or classifies it. B2NOTE is a standalone service for annotating data content hosted within the EUDAT CDI.

          There exist 3 types of annotations in B2Note

             - the semantic tag, a keyword from an ontology (a semantic tag coming from identified ontology repositories - currently only Bioportal
             - the free-text keyword, to be created and used when a specific semantic term is not found
             - the comment, a more comprehensive annotation

          Perfect for service providers who want to extend the (web based) service with annotation functionality

          ### Relevant:

WS-PGRADE provides a 'job wizard' interface for the user. Through this wizard the user can define, with a few clicks, a computational job that WS-PGRADE will execute on cloud resources of the EGI Applications On Demand infrastructure. The job can be easily scaled up into a parameter study, executing the same simulation on many different input sets. WS-PGRADE takes care of instantiation of a Virtual Machine image for jobs, sending user input for the jobs, and retrieving the results of computations.
#                         The Elastic Cloud Computing Cluster (EC3) is a platform that allows creating elastic virtual clusters on top of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) providers. Through a 'job wizard' interface, the user can configure the cluster with a pre-defined set of applications that will be deployed in the clouds underpinning the EGI Applications On Demand infrastructure. The installation and the configuration of the cluster are performed by means of the execution of Ansible receipts. The cluster configured by EC3 is private: as soon as it is configured You will have root access to the environment, and can setup and configure the cluster installing additional libraries and software to their needs.
#                         The EGI VMOps dashboard,a framework allows users to perform Virtual Machine (VM) management operations on the EGI Federated Cloud. The graphical interfaces of the dashboard allows the user to choose VMs from the AppDB Catalogue, to define an execution topology for them, and then to instantiate them on infrastructure as a service clouds.

          The service provides a browser-based tool for interactive analysis of data using EGI storage
          and compute infrastructures based on the JupyterHub technology. The notebooks can combine text,
          mathematics, computations and their rich media output using Jupyter technology, and can scale
          to multiple servers and multiple users (hub) with the EGI cloud service.

          ### The service is proposed in two options:

            1. For individual users EGI hosts and offers a JupyterHub within the Applications On Demand Service.
            Users (after lightweight approval) can login, write and play notebooks
            using storage and compute capacity from the access.egi.eu VO.
            2. For user communities EGI offers consultancy and technology
            to setup a community-specific JupyterHub on top of community VO
            (together with EGI-enbled compute and storage resources), and with community-specific storage/data.

        description: |
          DODAS acts as cloud enabler designed for scientists seeking to easily exploit distributed and heterogeneous clouds to process data. Aiming to reduce the learning curve as well as the operational cost of managing community specific services running on distributed cloud, DODAS completely automates the process of provisioning, creating, managing and accessing a pool of heterogeneous computing and storage resources.

          ### DODAS provides:

            - A comprehensive approach to opportunistic computing, with the possibility of
            orchestrate multiple centers (e.g. campus facilities, public or private clouds,
            to gather all available computing and storage resources).
            - A simple solution for elastic computing site extensions, e.g. extension
            of allocated resources in order to absorb peaks of usage.
            - An easy and controlled procedure to dynamically instantiate a spot ‘Data Analysis Facility’,
            for example a mission specific site. This is meant as the generation of an ephemeral WLCG-Tier
            as a Service to share computing and data resources with collaborators.
            - The support to create HTCondor batch systems and BigData Platform
            on demand over multi-backend IaaS cloud resources.

        description: |
          OPENCoastS builds on-demand circulation forecast systems for user-selected sections
          of the North Atlantic coast and maintains them running operationally for the timeframe defined by the user.
          This daily service generates forecasts of water levels and 2D velocities over the spatial region
          of interest for periods of 48 hours, based on numerical simulations of the relevant physical processes.
          Forcing conditions at the boundaries and over the domain are defined by the user
          from global forecast databases. Automatic comparison with real-time in-situ sensor data can be provided
          for a number of user specified locations.

          It takes advantage of LNEC’s team long-term work on coastal modelling as model developers,
          integrated in several open source modelling communities (SCHISM, ELCIRC, SELFE, ADCIRC),
          and in its advanced competences  in developing forecast frameworks and operating forecasts deployments.

          ### Users and application potential

          OPENCoastS can contribute directly to the development of new research methodologies
          and workflows regarding water quality, biological, biochemical and coastal erosion studies.

          SMEs will benefit from these operational systems to feed their own higher-level service portfolios
          to respond to other societal needs, without the need
          to invest time and resources to deploy forecast systems from scratch.

          Port and coastal authorities –Through the use of this platform coastal managers have all the information
          required to fulfill their responsibilities (examples of uses include facilitating navigation,
          reducing port operation costs, reducing emergency planning and response of coastal hazards,
          and better exploring recreational uses of the coast).


          ### How to request a service

          To request use of the OPENCoastS, please fill in thee request form and register at
          https://opencoasts.ncg.ingrid.pt/. After analysis and validation of the request,
          you will be allowed to log in and start building your forecasts.


          Service provided by

          OPENCoastS is provided by the Portuguese National Civil Engineering Laboratory,
          and was jointly developed by LNEC and LIP.

          Currently, the service is deployed at a single computing site (NCG-INGRID-PT,
          part of [INCD][1] and the [EGI Federation][2]).

          Through EOSC-hub, OPENCoastS will be expanded to include a more diverse set of geographical data,
          and improved with integration of new features from the EGI, EUDAT and INDIGO-DataCloud service catalogues.

        tagline: The IdP Proxy provides AAI services for both service providers and users.
        description: |
          For the user the feature is transparents: as soon as their IdP is integrated with the proxy,
          they are redirected by the service to their own IdP. Once integrated the IdP with the proxy,
          all the services using the IdP proxy will be available.

          The service providers will get all the AuthN/AuthZ information needed from the IdP Proxy
          (in form of attributes), without the need to deal with individual IdPs.

          Other components that can be attached to the IdP Proxy are credential translation services
          and attribute authorities.

          EGI provides services to manage user membership, where users can register and ask to be part of a VO,
          and where the VO supervisor can approve or remove users from the VO.
          The service is a third party service that can be queried by service providers
          to decide on user authorization.

          Currently EGI has in production: VOMS an X.509 based service

          In the wake of extending AAI capabilities, EGI will provide similar capabilities also
          for other authentication technologies, like OpenID and SAML2, for example.
