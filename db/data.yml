        description: "B2HANDLE is the distributed service for minting, storing, managing and accessing persistent identifiers (PIDs) and essential metadata (PID records) as well as managing PID namespaces. The implementation of the service relies on the DONA/Handle persistent identifier solution.

                      B2HANDLE can be used by middleware applications, end-user tools and other service to reliably identify data objects over longer timespans and through changes in object location or ownership. The B2HANDLE service encompasses management of identifier namespaces (Handle prefixes), establishment of policies and business workflows, operation of Handle servers and technical services, and a user-friendly Python library for general interaction with Handle servers and EUDAT-specific extensions. B2HANDLE is mostly transparents to end-users, shielding them from the complexity of infrastructure details. In the background, B2HANDLE operates as a federation and based on policies that aim to ensure high availability of Handle resolution by cross-site mirroring of Handles. B2HANDLE supports a dedicated Handle record structure (a PID profile) for the safe data management within an infrastructure with a given topology. By relying on features of the PID profile, end-users can, for instance, ensure authenticity of objects with checksums and timestamps and account for replicated objects across multiple locations.

                      ## Note:

                      To mint PIDs a prefix is required.

                         - the semantic tag, a keyword from an ontology (a semantic tag coming from identified ontology repositories - currently only Bioportal

B2SHARE is a solution that facilitates research data storage, guarantees long-term persistence of data and allows data, results or ideas to be shared worldwide.

                         - The basic production service comprises the following features:
                         - self-service registration for any scientists and researchers,
                         - free upload and registration of stable research data,
                         - data access policy is defined by the data owner,
                         - metadata is openly accessible and harvestable,
                         - customised metadata handling and customized user interfaces (e.g. for metadata acquisition),
                         - data integrity is ensured by checksums which are calculated during data ingest,
                         - the data is kept online, the storage usage base on the principle of fair share.

                      Perfect for the individuals researchers who do not have adequate facilities for storing, preserving and sharing data, B2SHARE Service is a customer-facing service which provides a safe repository for scientific data and a easy way to share it in the research community.

#
#                         The WS-PGRADE Portal (Web Services Parallel Grid Runtime and Developer Environment Portal) is a Liferay-based web portal. WS-PGRADE provides a 'job wizard' interface for the user. Through this wizard the user can define, with a few clicks, a computational job that WS-PGRADE will execute on cloud resources of the EGI Applications On Demand infrastructure. The job can be easily scaled up into a parameter study, executing the same simulation on many different input sets. WS-PGRADE takes care of instantiation of a Virtual Machine image for jobs, sending user input for the jobs, and retrieving the results of computations.
#                         The Elastic Cloud Computing Cluster (EC3) is a platform that allows creating elastic virtual clusters on top of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) providers. Through a 'job wizard' interface, the user can configure the cluster with a pre-defined set of applications that will be deployed in the clouds underpinning the EGI Applications On Demand infrastructure. The installation and the configuration of the cluster are performed by means of the execution of Ansible receipts. The cluster configured by EC3 is private: as soon as it is configured You will have root access to the environment, and can setup and configure the cluster installing additional libraries and software to their needs.
#                         The EGI VMOps dashboard,a framework allows users to perform Virtual Machine (VM) management operations on the EGI Federated Cloud. The graphical interfaces of the dashboard allows the user to choose VMs from the AppDB Catalogue, to define an execution topology for them, and then to instantiate them on infrastructure as a service clouds.

                      DODAS provides:

                          A comprehensive approach to opportunistic computing, with the possibility of orchestrate multiple centers (e.g. campus facilities, public or private clouds, to gather all available computing and storage resources).
                          A simple solution for elastic computing site extensions, e.g. extension of allocated resources in order to absorb peaks of usage.
                          An easy and controlled procedure to dynamically instantiate a spot ‘Data Analysis Facility’, for example a mission specific site. This is meant as the generation of an ephemeral WLCG-Tier as a Service to share computing and data resources with collaborators.

This daily service generates forecasts of water levels and 2D velocities over the spatial region of interest for periods of 48 hours, based on numerical simulations of the relevant physical processes. Forcing conditions at the boundaries and over the domain are defined by the user from global forecast databases. Automatic comparison with real-time in-situ sensor data can be provided for a number of user specified locations.

                      It takes advantage of LNEC’s team long-term work on coastal modelling as model developers, integrated in several open source modelling communities (SCHISM, ELCIRC, SELFE, ADCIRC), and in its advanced competences  in developing forecast frameworks and operating forecasts deployments.


                      Users and application potential

                      OPENCoastS can contribute directly to the development of new research methodologies and workflows regarding water quality, biological, biochemical and coastal erosion studies.

                      SMEs will benefit from these operational systems to feed their own higher-level service portfolios to respond to other societal needs, without the need to invest time and resources to deploy forecast systems from scratch.

                      Port and coastal authorities –Through the use of this platform coastal managers have all the information required to fulfill their responsibilities (examples of uses include facilitating navigation, reducing port operation costs, reducing emergency planning and response of coastal hazards, and better exploring recreational uses of the coast).


                      How to request a service

                      To request use of the OPENCoastS, please fill in thee request form and register at https://opencoasts.ncg.ingrid.pt/. After analysis and validation of the request, you will be allowed to log in and start building your forecasts.


                      Service provided by

                      OPENCoastS is provided by the Portuguese National Civil Engineering Laboratory, and was jointly developed by LNEC and LIP.

                      Currently, the service is deployed at a single computing site (NCG-INGRID-PT, part of INCD and the EGI Federation).

                      Through EOSC-hub, OPENCoastS will be expanded to include a more diverse set of geographical data, and improved with integration of new features from the EGI, EUDAT and INDIGO-DataCloud service catalogues."
