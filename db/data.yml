          B2HANDLE is the distributed service for minting, storing, managing and accessing persistent identifiers (PIDs) and essential metadata (PID records) as well as managing PID namespaces. The implementation of the service relies on the DONA/Handle persistent identifier solution.

          B2HANDLE can be used by middleware applications, end-user tools and other service to reliably identify data objects over longer timespans and through changes in object location or ownership. The B2HANDLE service encompasses management of identifier namespaces (Handle prefixes), establishment of policies and business workflows, operation of Handle servers and technical services, and a user-friendly Python library for general interaction with Handle servers and EUDAT-specific extensions. B2HANDLE is mostly transparents to end-users, shielding them from the complexity of infrastructure details. In the background, B2HANDLE operates as a federation and based on policies that aim to ensure high availability of Handle resolution by cross-site mirroring of Handles. B2HANDLE supports a dedicated Handle record structure (a PID profile) for the safe data management within an infrastructure with a given topology. By relying on features of the PID profile, end-users can, for instance, ensure authenticity of objects with checksums and timestamps and account for replicated objects across multiple locations.

          ### Note:

          To mint PIDs a prefix is required.


          ### To access the service you need to:

             1. Requests access to PID service or namespace (Prefix) select one of service options below.

        description: |
          B2Note allows to easily create, search and manage annotations. An annotation is a keyword or commentary attached to a dete object (data collection, file) that explains or classifies it. B2NOTE is a standalone service for annotating data content hosted within the EUDAT CDI.

          There exist 3 types of annotations in B2Note

             - the semantic tag, a keyword from an ontology (a semantic tag coming from identified ontology repositories - currently only Bioportal
             - the free-text keyword, to be created and used when a specific semantic term is not found
             - the comment, a more comprehensive annotation

          Perfect for service providers who want to extend the (web based) service with annotation functionality

          ### Relevant:

          User must register to create and maintain annotations, additional access registration can be applied on the service which enabled annotation functionality via B2NOTE. Service providers willing to enable annotation via B2NOTE on an existing service can request consultancy and support.

          ### To access the service you need to:

             1. The EUDAT public B2NOTE service (https://b2note.eudat.eu) is offered as a fairshare free-to-use service, no registration is required to search through the B2NOTE, registration is needed to store and manage annotations.

              (which is not the case for hand-written counter-parts). The search results can be visualized
              in the User Interface and refined before being exported either as JSON-LD for reuse
              with your analysis workflow/script/software. B2NOTE also allows users to export all the annotations
              about a file as JSON-LD for your own purpose. This first release of B2NOTE is
              a crowdsourcing annotation service meaning that all annotations will be publicly available.
              To preserve the anonymity of the user, you should register and create an annotator pseudonym.

              Block Storage is a block-level storage solution that allows you to expand the storage capacity
              of your instances in the EGI Federated Cloud. This means you can increase your storage
              without increasing the size or capacity of your instance or by provisioning new ones.
              Once you mount and format your drive, you can use it just like a regular hard drive
              attached to your server. Or you can detach your block storage volume from one server
              and attach it to another. Or you can delete your server, keeping your data intact
              and ready for the next time you need it.

#        description: "Features:
#
#                         User-friendly access to online applications that can be executed on parallel architectures (EGI Cloud and High-Throughput Compute)
#                         Application development and hosting frameworks where custom applications can be executed on EGI Cloud Compute and High-Throughput Compute services
#                         User support is available by an international network of consultants.
#
#                     Development frameworks:
#
#                         The WS-PGRADE Portal (Web Services Parallel Grid Runtime and Developer Environment Portal) is a Liferay-based web portal. WS-PGRADE provides a 'job wizard' interface for the user. Through this wizard the user can define, with a few clicks, a computational job that WS-PGRADE will execute on cloud resources of the EGI Applications On Demand infrastructure. The job can be easily scaled up into a parameter study, executing the same simulation on many different input sets. WS-PGRADE takes care of instantiation of a Virtual Machine image for jobs, sending user input for the jobs, and retrieving the results of computations.
#                         The Elastic Cloud Computing Cluster (EC3) is a platform that allows creating elastic virtual clusters on top of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) providers. Through a 'job wizard' interface, the user can configure the cluster with a pre-defined set of applications that will be deployed in the clouds underpinning the EGI Applications On Demand infrastructure. The installation and the configuration of the cluster are performed by means of the execution of Ansible receipts. The cluster configured by EC3 is private: as soon as it is configured You will have root access to the environment, and can setup and configure the cluster installing additional libraries and software to their needs.
#                         The EGI VMOps dashboard,a framework allows users to perform Virtual Machine (VM) management operations on the EGI Federated Cloud. The graphical interfaces of the dashboard allows the user to choose VMs from the AppDB Catalogue, to define an execution topology for them, and then to instantiate them on infrastructure as a service clouds.

        The service provides a browser-based tool for interactive analysis of data using EGI storage
        and compute infrastructures based on the JupyterHub technology. The notebooks can combine text,
        mathematics, computations and their rich media output using Jupyter technology, and can scale
        to multiple servers and multiple users (hub) with the EGI cloud service.

        ### The service is proposed in two options:

          1. For individual users EGI hosts and offers a JupyterHub within the Applications On Demand Service.
          Users (after lightweight approval) can login, write and play notebooks
          using storage and compute capacity from the access.egi.eu VO.
          2. For user communities EGI offers consultancy and technology
          to setup a community-specific JupyterHub on top of community VO
          (together with EGI-enbled compute and storage resources), and with community-specific storage/data.

        description: |
          DODAS acts as cloud enabler designed for scientists seeking to easily exploit distributed
          and heterogeneous clouds to process data. Aiming to reduce the learning curve as well as
          the operational cost of managing community specific services running on distributed cloud,
          DODAS completely automates the process of provisioning, creating, managing and accessing
          a pool of heterogeneous computing and storage resources.

          ### DODAS provides:

            - A comprehensive approach to opportunistic computing, with the possibility of
            orchestrate multiple centers (e.g. campus facilities, public or private clouds,
            to gather all available computing and storage resources).
            - A simple solution for elastic computing site extensions, e.g. extension
            of allocated resources in order to absorb peaks of usage.
            - An easy and controlled procedure to dynamically instantiate a spot ‘Data Analysis Facility’,
            for example a mission specific site. This is meant as the generation of an ephemeral WLCG-Tier
            as a Service to share computing and data resources with collaborators.
            - The support to create HTCondor batch systems and BigData Platform
            on demand over multi-backend IaaS cloud resources.


          ### How to access the service

          To access the DODAS service, users are first required to [register online][1].


          ### See the online manual:

          https://dodas.gitbook.io/dynamic-on-demand-analysis-service


          ### Service provided by

          The service is provided by the Italian National Institute of Nuclear Physics (INFN).

          The DODAS service builds on EOSC-hub services developed during the INDIGO-DataCloud project
          (Identity Access Management - IAM, Token Translation Service - TTS, PaaS Orchestration, TOSCA Templates).

          OPENCoastS builds on-demand circulation forecast systems for user-selected sections
          of the North Atlantic coast and maintains them running operationally for the timeframe defined by the user.
          This daily service generates forecasts of water levels and 2D velocities over the spatial region
          of interest for periods of 48 hours, based on numerical simulations of the relevant physical processes.
          Forcing conditions at the boundaries and over the domain are defined by the user
          from global forecast databases. Automatic comparison with real-time in-situ sensor data can be provided
          for a number of user specified locations.

          It takes advantage of LNEC’s team long-term work on coastal modelling as model developers,
          integrated in several open source modelling communities (SCHISM, ELCIRC, SELFE, ADCIRC),
          and in its advanced competences  in developing forecast frameworks and operating forecasts deployments.

          ### Users and application potential

          OPENCoastS can contribute directly to the development of new research methodologies
          and workflows regarding water quality, biological, biochemical and coastal erosion studies.

          SMEs will benefit from these operational systems to feed their own higher-level service portfolios
          to respond to other societal needs, without the need
          to invest time and resources to deploy forecast systems from scratch.

          Port and coastal authorities –Through the use of this platform coastal managers have all the information
          required to fulfill their responsibilities (examples of uses include facilitating navigation,
          reducing port operation costs, reducing emergency planning and response of coastal hazards,
          and better exploring recreational uses of the coast).


          ### How to request a service

          To request use of the OPENCoastS, please fill in thee request form and register at
          https://opencoasts.ncg.ingrid.pt/. After analysis and validation of the request,
          you will be allowed to log in and start building your forecasts.


          Service provided by

          OPENCoastS is provided by the Portuguese National Civil Engineering Laboratory,
          and was jointly developed by LNEC and LIP.

          Currently, the service is deployed at a single computing site (NCG-INGRID-PT,
          part of [INCD][1] and the [EGI Federation][2]).

          Through EOSC-hub, OPENCoastS will be expanded to include a more diverse set of geographical data,
          and improved with integration of new features from the EGI, EUDAT and INDIGO-DataCloud service catalogues.

          Check-in is a proxy service that operates as a central hub to connect federated Identity Providers (IdPs)
          with service providers. Check-in allows users to select their preferred IdP so that they can access and use
          services in a uniform and easy way. For the user the feature is transparent:
          as soon as their IdP is integrated with the proxy, they are redirected by the service to their own IdP.
          Once integrated the IdP with the proxy, all the services using the IdP proxy will be available.
          The service providers will get all the AuthN/AuthZ information needed from the IdP Proxy
          (in form of attributes), without the need to deal with individual IdPs.
          Other components that can be attached to the IdP Proxy are credential translation services
          and attribute authorities.

          ### Main characteristics:

            - Enables multiple federated authentication sources using
            different technologies
            - Increased productivity and security
            - Federated in eduGAIN as a service provider, publishingREFEDS RnSandSirtficompliance
            - User registration portal to allow accounts-linkingo
            - Combines user attributes originating from various authoritative sources
            (IdPs and attribute provider services) and delivers them to the connected service providers
            in a transparent way.

          ### Features:

          - Enables federated access to services:
              *Support for IdPs: SAML2.0, OIDC

          EGI provides services to manage user membership, where users can register and ask to be part of a VO,
          and where the VO supervisor can approve or remove users from the VO.
          The service is a third party service that can be queried by service providers
          to decide on user authorization.

          Currently EGI has in production: VOMS an X.509 based service

          In the wake of extending AAI capabilities, EGI will provide similar capabilities also
          for other authentication technologies, like OpenID and SAML2, for example.

        Alien and Invasive Species Virtual Research Environment (VRE) is a web-based, comprehensive,
        collaborative working environment supporting decision makers and scientists in predicting the spread
        of an invasive species (possibly alien) in a new environment. The VRE hosts examples of suitable habitat maps
        produced for today and 2050 in new areas for more than 11,000 species and provides models and workflows
        to combine environmental data with species observations in their habitats to predict their future spread.

        ### Features:
          - A service providing state-of-the art Data Analytics algorithms suitable for alien
            and invasive species spread prediction;
          - A service for seamless discovery and access to species occurrence data and taxa names
            from several providers providers (eg. BrazilianFlora, OBIS, WoRMS, GBIF, ITIS, CatalogueOfLife);
          - A complete spatial data infrastructure for discovering, accessing and publishing
            spatial datasets according to OGC standards;
          - A catalogue service for discovering, accessing and publishing any research object
            (multi-part objects with actionable parts) and promoting its re-use;
          - A social networking service supporting communication among VRE members by sharing and commenting posts;

        PROMINENCE is a platform which allows users to exploit idle cloud resources for running scientific workloads
        with a simple batch system style interface. Key features include:

          - Jobs can be submitted from anywhere using any OS and any language.
          - All jobs are run in containers to ensure they will can run reliably anywhere and are reproducible.
          - Multi-node OpenMPI jobs can be run in addition to HTC jobs.
          - On-premises resources can be utilised with the ability to burst onto external clouds
            at times of peak demand.
          - Goes beyond bursting onto a single external cloud with hierarchical cloud bursting.
            For example, burst onto national research clouds, to EGI FedCloud and finally to public clouds.
          - All infrastructure provisioning is handled completely automatically and is totally transparent to the user.
          - Clouds are selected automatically based on job requirements and preferences,
            and any failures are handled automatically.
          - Output data can be accessed from cloud-based object storage.
