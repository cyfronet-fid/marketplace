      B2HANDLE is the distributed service for minting, storing, managing and accessing persistent identifiers (PIDs) and essential metadata (PID records) as well as managing PID namespaces. The implementation of the service relies on the DONA/Handle persistent identifier solution.

      B2HANDLE can be used by middleware applications, end-user tools and other service to reliably identify data objects over longer timespans and through changes in object location or ownership. The B2HANDLE service encompasses management of identifier namespaces (Handle prefixes), establishment of policies and business workflows, operation of Handle servers and technical services, and a user-friendly Python library for general interaction with Handle servers and EUDAT-specific extensions. B2HANDLE is mostly transparents to end-users, shielding them from the complexity of infrastructure details. In the background, B2HANDLE operates as a federation and based on policies that aim to ensure high availability of Handle resolution by cross-site mirroring of Handles. B2HANDLE supports a dedicated Handle record structure (a PID profile) for the safe data management within an infrastructure with a given topology. By relying on features of the PID profile, end-users can, for instance, ensure authenticity of objects with checksums and timestamps and account for replicated objects across multiple locations.

      ### Note:

      To mint PIDs a prefix is required.


      ### To access the service you need to:

         1. Requests access to PID service or namespace (Prefix) select one of service options below.
         2. Set the relevant parameters and add the service to the cart.
         3. Go to the cart and submit your order.
         4. You will receive an email summarising your order.

        description: |
          Block Storage is a block-level storage solution that allows you to expand the storage capacity
          of your instances in the EGI Federated Cloud. This means you can increase your storage
          without increasing the size or capacity of your instance or by provisioning new ones.
          Once you mount and format your drive, you can use it just like a regular hard drive
          attached to your server. Or you can detach your block storage volume from one server
          and attach it to another. Or you can delete your server, keeping your data intact
          and ready for the next time you need it.

    platforms: [*egiPlatform]
    description: |
      The service provides a browser-based tool for interactive analysis of data using EGI storage
      and compute infrastructures based on the JupyterHub technology. The notebooks can combine text,
      mathematics, computations and their rich media output using Jupyter technology, and can scale
      to multiple servers and multiple users (hub) with the EGI cloud service.

      ### The service is proposed in two options:

        1. For individual users EGI hosts and offers a JupyterHub within the Applications On Demand Service.
        Users (after lightweight approval) can login, write and play notebooks
        using storage and compute capacity from the access.egi.eu VO.
        2. For user communities EGI offers consultancy and technology
        to setup a community-specific JupyterHub on top of community VO
        (together with EGI-enbled compute and storage resources), and with community-specific storage/data.

    platforms: [*egiPlatform]
    description: |
      Check-in is a proxy service that operates as a central hub to connect federated Identity Providers (IdPs)
      with service providers. Check-in allows users to select their preferred IdP so that they can access and use
      services in a uniform and easy way. For the user the feature is transparent:
      as soon as their IdP is integrated with the proxy, they are redirected by the service to their own IdP.
      Once integrated the IdP with the proxy, all the services using the IdP proxy will be available.
      The service providers will get all the AuthN/AuthZ information needed from the IdP Proxy
      (in form of attributes), without the need to deal with individual IdPs.

      Other components that can be attached to the IdP Proxy are credential translation services
      and attribute authorities.

      ### Main characteristics:

        - Enables multiple federated authentication sources using
        different technologies
        - Increased productivity and security
        - Federated in eduGAIN as a service provider, publishingREFEDS RnSandSirtficompliance

    platforms: [*eoscHub, *aodp]
    description: |
      The Elastic Cloud Computing Cluster (EC3) is a platform that allows creating elastic virtual clusters
      on top of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) providers, either public (such as Amazon Web Services,
      Google Cloud or Microsoft Azure) or on-premises (such as OpenNebula and OpenStack).
      Through a 'job wizard' interface, the user can configure the virtual cluster with a predefined set
      of applications that will be deployed in the clouds underpinning the EGI Applications On Demand infrastructure.
      The installation and the configuration of the cluster are performed by means of the execution
      of Ansible receipts. The cluster configured by EC3 is private: as soon as it is configured
      the user will have root access to the environment, and can setup and configure the cluster
      installing additional libraries and software to their needs.

      ### Features:

        - Federated authentication through the EGI Applications on Demand service.
        - Web based access.
        - Interoperability with most widely used IaaS cloud technologies
        - Wizard interface to streamline the configuration and the deployment of the virtual cluster on top of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) providers.
        - Several Ansible receipts are available to deploy applications and tools in the cluster nodes.
        - Nodes of the clusters will be self-managed by CLUES. Working nodes will be undeployed when they are idle.
        - Use of ‘per-user subproxies’ from EGI to access X.509-protected resources on the users’ behalf.
