                         The WS-PGRADE Portal (Web Services Parallel Grid Runtime and Developer Environment Portal) is a Liferay-based web portal. WS-PGRADE provides a 'job wizard' interface for the user. Through this wizard the user can define, with a few clicks, a computational job that WS-PGRADE will execute on cloud resources of the EGI Applications On Demand infrastructure. The job can be easily scaled up into a parameter study, executing the same simulation on many different input sets. WS-PGRADE takes care of instantiation of a Virtual Machine image for jobs, sending user input for the jobs, and retrieving the results of computations.
                         The Elastic Cloud Computing Cluster (EC3) is a platform that allows creating elastic virtual clusters on top of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) providers. Through a 'job wizard' interface, the user can configure the cluster with a pre-defined set of applications that will be deployed in the clouds underpinning the EGI Applications On Demand infrastructure. The installation and the configuration of the cluster are performed by means of the execution of Ansible receipts. The cluster configured by EC3 is private: as soon as it is configured You will have root access to the environment, and can setup and configure the cluster installing additional libraries and software to their needs.
                         The EGI VMOps dashboard,a framework allows users to perform Virtual Machine (VM) management operations on the EGI Federated Cloud. The graphical interfaces of the dashboard allows the user to choose VMs from the AppDB Catalogue, to define an execution topology for them, and then to instantiate them on infrastructure as a service clouds.

This daily service generates forecasts of water levels and 2D velocities over the spatial region of interest for periods of 48 hours, based on numerical simulations of the relevant physical processes. Forcing conditions at the boundaries and over the domain are defined by the user from global forecast databases. Automatic comparison with real-time in-situ sensor data can be provided for a number of user specified locations.

                      It takes advantage of LNEC’s team long-term work on coastal modelling as model developers, integrated in several open source modelling communities (SCHISM, ELCIRC, SELFE, ADCIRC), and in its advanced competences  in developing forecast frameworks and operating forecasts deployments.


                      Users and application potential

                      OPENCoastS can contribute directly to the development of new research methodologies and workflows regarding water quality, biological, biochemical and coastal erosion studies.

                      SMEs will benefit from these operational systems to feed their own higher-level service portfolios to respond to other societal needs, without the need to invest time and resources to deploy forecast systems from scratch.

                      Port and coastal authorities –Through the use of this platform coastal managers have all the information required to fulfill their responsibilities (examples of uses include facilitating navigation, reducing port operation costs, reducing emergency planning and response of coastal hazards, and better exploring recreational uses of the coast).
