      B2HANDLE is the distributed service for minting, storing, managing and accessing persistent identifiers (PIDs) and essential metadata (PID records) as well as managing PID namespaces. The implementation of the service relies on the DONA/Handle persistent identifier solution.

      B2HANDLE can be used by middleware applications, end-user tools and other service to reliably identify data objects over longer timespans and through changes in object location or ownership. The B2HANDLE service encompasses management of identifier namespaces (Handle prefixes), establishment of policies and business workflows, operation of Handle servers and technical services, and a user-friendly Python library for general interaction with Handle servers and EUDAT-specific extensions. B2HANDLE is mostly transparents to end-users, shielding them from the complexity of infrastructure details. In the background, B2HANDLE operates as a federation and based on policies that aim to ensure high availability of Handle resolution by cross-site mirroring of Handles. B2HANDLE supports a dedicated Handle record structure (a PID profile) for the safe data management within an infrastructure with a given topology. By relying on features of the PID profile, end-users can, for instance, ensure authenticity of objects with checksums and timestamps and account for replicated objects across multiple locations.

      ### Note:

      To mint PIDs a prefix is required.


      ### To access the service you need to:

         1. Requests access to PID service or namespace (Prefix) select one of service options below.
         2. Set the relevant parameters and add the service to the cart.
         3. Go to the cart and submit your order.

          identifiers (PIDs) and essential metadata (PID records) as well as managing PID namespaces.
          The implementation of the service relies on the DONA/Handle persistent identifier solution.
          Features: Unique and persistent reference which are globally resolvable,
          Network of service providers for high PIDs and PID services, Sustainability framework to sustain PIDs
          over long periods of time, Unified technical interface for access, registration and modification
          of PIDs and PID records, Operational management of PID namespaces (prefixes) transparent
          to user communities, including replication. Local reverse-lookups to retrive Handles base
          on target location or other fields, Client0side application support through a Python library.
          Compatible with common standards and practices (e.g. RDA).
          Ideal for: Data Providers

    tagline: Data annotation service to create annotations on research data
    platforms: [*eudatPlatform]
    description: |
      B2Note allows to easily create, search and manage annotations. An annotation is a keyword or commentary attached to a dete object (data collection, file) that explains or classifies it. B2NOTE is a standalone service for annotating data content hosted within the EUDAT CDI.

      There exist 3 types of annotations in B2Note

         - the semantic tag, a keyword from an ontology (a semantic tag coming from identified ontology repositories - currently only Bioportal
         - the free-text keyword, to be created and used when a specific semantic term is not found
         - the comment, a more comprehensive annotation

      Perfect for service providers who want to extend the (web based) service with annotation functionality

      ### Relevant:

      User must register to create and maintain annotations, additional access registration can be applied on the service which enabled annotation functionality via B2NOTE. Service providers willing to enable annotation via B2NOTE on an existing service can request consultancy and support.

      ### To access the service you need to:

         1. The EUDAT public B2NOTE service (https://b2note.eudat.eu) is offered as a fairshare free-to-use service, no registration is required to search through the B2NOTE, registration is needed to store and manage annotations.
         2. Request for integraton within existing services select the service option below.
         3. Provide URL to service

          B2NOTE is a service that allows you to easily and intuitively create annotations on research data
          hosted in the EUDAT Collaborative Data Infrastructure. These annotations are created and stored
          in a computer-readable format (using the W3C Web Annotation model) and therefore are searchable
          (which is not the case for hand-written counter-parts). The search results can be visualized
          in the User Interface and refined before being exported either as JSON-LD for reuse
          with your analysis workflow/script/software. B2NOTE also allows users to export all the annotations
          about a file as JSON-LD for your own purpose. This first release of B2NOTE is
          a crowdsourcing annotation service meaning that all annotations will be publicly available.
          To preserve the anonymity of the user, you should register and create an annotator pseudonym.

          Block Storage is a block-level storage solution that allows you to expand the storage capacity
          of your instances in the EGI Federated Cloud. This means you can increase your storage
          without increasing the size or capacity of your instance or by provisioning new ones.
          Once you mount and format your drive, you can use it just like a regular hard drive
          attached to your server. Or you can detach your block storage volume from one server
          and attach it to another. Or you can delete your server, keeping your data intact
          and ready for the next time you need it.

      A virtual collection is a coherent set of links to digital objects (e.g. annotated text, video)
      that can be easily created, accessed and cited. The links can originate from different archives,
      hence the term virtual.


      CLARIN provides a [registry][1] where scholars can create and publish their virtual collections.
      It provides [persistent identifiers and federated login][2].


      The collection metadata is openly available and accessible via the [Virtual Language Observatory][3].
      The referenced digital objects can also be processed with the [Language Resource Switchboard][4].

          A service that allows researchers to create their own citable digital bookmarks.


          A virtual collection is a coherent set of links to digital objects (e.g. annotated text, video)
          that can be easily created, accessed and cited. The links can originate from different archives,
          hence the term virtual.


          CLARIN provides a registry where scholars can create and publish their virtual collections.
          It provides persistent identifiers and federated login.


          The collection metadata is openly available and accessible via the Virtual Language Observatory.
          The referenced digital objects can also be processed with the Language Resource Switchboard.

      DODAS acts as cloud enabler designed for scientists seeking to easily exploit distributed
      and heterogeneous clouds to process data. Aiming to reduce the learning curve as well as
      the operational cost of managing community specific services running on distributed cloud,
      DODAS completely automates the process of provisioning, creating, managing and accessing
      a pool of heterogeneous computing and storage resources.

      ### DODAS provides:

        - A comprehensive approach to opportunistic computing, with the possibility of
        orchestrate multiple centers (e.g. campus facilities, public or private clouds,
        to gather all available computing and storage resources).
        - A simple solution for elastic computing site extensions, e.g. extension
        of allocated resources in order to absorb peaks of usage.
        - An easy and controlled procedure to dynamically instantiate a spot â€˜Data Analysis Facilityâ€™,
        for example a mission specific site. This is meant as the generation of an ephemeral WLCG-Tier
        as a Service to share computing and data resources with collaborators.
        - The support to create HTCondor batch systems and BigData Platform
        on demand over multi-backend IaaS cloud resources.


      ### How to access the service

      To access the DODAS service, users are first required to [register online][1].


      ### See the online manual:

      along with version history and dataset statistics, which allows to monitor the interest in datasets.
      CKAN also provides functionalities for collaboration, community participation and providing feedback,
      such as comments, ratings and sharing.
      CKAN is highly customizable in both terms of Look&Feel and functionalities.
      CKAN provides very rich RESTful JSON API, which allows other applications to discover and access the datasets.
      It can be integrated easily with Semantic Web technologies such as RDF data model and SPARQL.

    description: |
      Check-in is a proxy service that operates as a central hub to connect federated Identity Providers (IdPs)
      with service providers. Check-in allows users to select their preferred IdP so that they can access and use
      services in a uniform and easy way. For the user the feature is transparent:
      as soon as their IdP is integrated with the proxy, they are redirected by the service to their own IdP.
      Once integrated the IdP with the proxy, all the services using the IdP proxy will be available.
      The service providers will get all the AuthN/AuthZ information needed from the IdP Proxy
      (in form of attributes), without the need to deal with individual IdPs.

      Other components that can be attached to the IdP Proxy are credential translation services
      and attribute authorities.

      ### Main characteristics:

        - Enables multiple federated authentication sources using
        different technologies
        - Increased productivity and security
        - Federated in eduGAIN as a service provider, publishingREFEDS RnSandSirtficompliance
        - User registration portal to allow accounts-linkingo
        - Combines user attributes originating from various authoritative sources
        (IdPs and attribute provider services) and delivers them to the connected service providers
        in a transparent way.

      ### Features:

      - Enables federated access to services:
          *Support for IdPs: SAML2.0, OIDC

      that having a robust firewall around a system that provides a full separation of projects, is the best policy.
      A two-step authentication is needed to gain access to the system. Inside the system,
      every project has its own VLAN and its own virtual file system.
      This means that projects cannot find any information about any other project on the system.

    tagline: Deploy a virtual cluster on top of IaaS infrastructures with a few clicks.
    platforms: [*eoscHub, *aodp]
    description: |
      The Elastic Cloud Computing Cluster (EC3) is a platform that allows creating elastic virtual clusters
      on top of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) providers, either public (such as Amazon Web Services,
      Google Cloud or Microsoft Azure) or on-premises (such as OpenNebula and OpenStack).
      Through a 'job wizard' interface, the user can configure the virtual cluster with a predefined set
      of applications that will be deployed in the clouds underpinning the EGI Applications On Demand infrastructure.
      The installation and the configuration of the cluster are performed by means of the execution
      of Ansible receipts. The cluster configured by EC3 is private: as soon as it is configured
      the user will have root access to the environment, and can setup and configure the cluster
      installing additional libraries and software to their needs.

      ### Features:

        - Federated authentication through the EGI Applications on Demand service.
        - Web based access.
        - Interoperability with most widely used IaaS cloud technologies
        - Wizard interface to streamline the configuration and the deployment of the virtual cluster on top of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) providers.
        - Several Ansible receipts are available to deploy applications and tools in the cluster nodes.
        - Nodes of the clusters will be self-managed by CLUES. Working nodes will be undeployed when they are idle.
        - Use of â€˜per-user subproxiesâ€™ from EGI to access X.509-protected resources on the usersâ€™ behalf.
